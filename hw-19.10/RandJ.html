        Act.1<br><br>
Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.<br><br>


<b>Scene I. Verona.A public place.</b><br><br>
Enter Sampson and Gregory , of the house of Capulet, armed with swords andd bucklers <br><br>
<b>Sampson</b><br><br>
Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.<br><br>
<b>Gregory</b><br><br>
No,fot then we should be colliers<br>
