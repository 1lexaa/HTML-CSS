<h1>Mathematical formulas</h1>

<h2>Linear Equations</h2>

<p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>

<h3>ax + b = 0</h3>

<p>where <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are real numbers and <b>x</b> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear<br>
    equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <b>x</b><br>
    so don't get too locket into always seeing and <b>x</b> there
</p>   

<h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>

<p>The standard form of a Quadratic equation look like this</p>

<h3>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</h3>

<p> where <b>a,b,c</b> are known values and <b>x</b> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet) Also, <b>a</b> can't be 0</p>

<h2>The area of a circle (A)</h2>

<p><b>П</b>(Pi) times the radius (<b>r</b>) squared.</p>


<h3>A = П x r<sup>2</sup></h3>

<p>or , when you know the circumference</p>

<h3>A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 x П</h3>

<h2>Intersection</h2>

<p>The Intersection of two sets <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, denoted by /\ B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets<br>
A and B in symbols,</p>

<h3>A /\ B = { x : x э A and x э B}</h3>

<p>That is <b>x</b> is and element of the Intersection A /\ B if and only if <b>x</b> is both an element of <b>B</b>..........</p>
